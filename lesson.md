Here are some queries we'd like you to answer using this ActiveRecord database. Remember, you can write your own queries using the **ModelName.find_by_sql** method.

1. Get a list of all users in California

  ```
  SELECT *
  FROM users
  ```

2. Get a list of all airports in Minnesota
3. Get a list of all payment methods used on itineraries by the user with email address "heidenreich_kara@kunde.net"
4. Get a list of prices of all flights whose origins are in Kochfurt Probably International Airport.
5. Find a list of all Airport names and codes which connect to the airport coded LYT.
6. Get a list of all airports visited by user Danny D'Amore after January 1, 2015. (Hint, see if you can get a list of all ticket IDs first).
